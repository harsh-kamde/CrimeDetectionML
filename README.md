# CrimeDetectionML: Detecting the criminal activities in CCTV videos

## Overview: 
In this project we used the deep learning techniques like CNN and LSTM to identify the activities in a video. 
If a criminal activity is found then the clip is cut out and stored to the firebase.
The generated clip is stored along with other information i.e. accuracy, crime_type, time-date
An alert message is sent to the respective authority using our flutter Mobile App

## Technology used: 
Convolutional Neural Network
Long Short Term Memory
OpenCV
Python
